Design Choices :

* Password Generation
    The generate_password function combines characters from string.ascii_letters, string.digits, and string.punctuation to create a diverse set of characters for the password.
    This ensures a high level of randomness and complexity in the generated passwords.

* User Interface
    The program presents a stylish welcome message using a formatted string. The user interacts with the program by entering 'yes' to generate a new password or any
    other input to exit the application.

* Loop Structure
    The main loop (while True) provides a continuous user interface, prompting the user for input. If the user decides not to generate a new password, the loop exits, and
    the program concludes.

Summary :
    The Random Password Generator is a Python program designed to generate secure and random passwords for users. The program utilizes the random and string libraries
    to create passwords with a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and special characters. The user interacts with the program through a simple
    command-line interface, choosing whether to generate a new password or exit the application.

Features :

    - Password Complexity: The generated passwords include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, enhancing security.
    - Stylish Welcome Message: The program starts with a visually appealing welcome message to enhance the user experience.
    - User Interaction: The user is prompted to decide whether to generate a new password or exit the application.

Potential Enhancements :

    - Password Length Configuration: Allow users to specify the length of the generated passwords.
    - Strength Indicator: Implement a feature to provide users with information about the strength of the generated password (e.g., weak, medium, strong).
    - Password History: Maintain a history of generated passwords for reference or retrieval.

Conclusion :

    The Random Password Generator is a simple yet effective tool for creating secure passwords. Its straightforward design ensures ease of use, while potential
    enhancements could further improve user customization and password management capabilities. This document provides an overview of the program's design choices,
    features, and suggests potential enhancements for future development.
